From the moment the e-commerce payment systems came to existence, there have always been people who will find new ways to access someone’s finances illegally. This has become a major problem in the modern era, as all transactions can easily be completed online by only entering your credit card information.

Payment card fraud is a major challenge for businesses, payment card issuers and transactional service companies. The losses from payment card fraud reached 28.6 billion worldwide in 2019 according to [Nilson Report Data](https://nilsonreport.com/content_promo.php?id_promo=16). United States alone is responsible for more than a third of the total global loss, making it the most card fraud prone country in the world. 

The corona virus pandemic has also fueled an explosive growth in card fraud activity because many consumers and retailers decided it was not worth the risk and pivoted to using their bank cards and phones to make everyday purchases. In the UK, card payments were 75.3% higher in early April 2020 compared with a year earlier, while contactless payment limits also rose to $100, making the switch to contactless even more appealing.

Unfortunately, this rapid change was overshadowed by increased levels of fraud. It impacts consumers, merchants and issuers alike. Its economic cost goes far beyond the cost of illegally purchased merchandise because businesses often spend millions to protect themselves from fraud. Big businesses can absorb some amount of losses but if a small one-shop business or a restaurant all of a sudden has a $10,000 loss, that could be the difference between making payroll and not making payroll for that company.

It should also be noted that fraud detection is a cat and mouse game, where fraudulent patterns change over time. As technology evolves, both in terms of fraud prevention and ease of use of payment systems, so do fraudster techniques. They adapt by moving from the old (and by now fixed) targets to the vulnerability of the new technologies.

Credit card fraud detection (CCFD) is like looking for needles in a haystack. It requires finding, out of millions of daily transactions, which ones are fraudulent. Due to the ever-increasing amount of data, it is now almost impossible for a human specialist to detect meaningful patterns from transaction data. For this reason, the use of machine learning techniques is now widespread in the field of fraud detection, where information extraction from large datasets is required.

Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning is a process of data investigation and the development of a model that will provide the best results in revealing and preventing fraudulent transactions. This is achieved through bringing together all meaningful features of card users’ transactions. The information is then run through a subtly trained model that finds patterns and rules so that it can classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or is legitimate. 

# Objective

*   Train a Machine Learning Model with historic data to learn patterns behind fraudulent behavior to enable the model filter out fraudulent transactions and stop them from occurring in real-time.

#  Data

Simulated credit card transaction dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection) containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

This was generated using [Sparkov Data Generation | GitHub](https://github.com/namebrandon/Sparkov_Data_Generation) tool created by Brandon Harris. This simulation was run for the duration - 1 Jan 2019 to 31 Dec 2020. The files were then combined and converted into a standard format.

SMOTE to handle the imbalance in the dataset
The challenge of working with imbalanced datasets is that most machine learning techniques will ignore the minority class and in turn have poor performance. One approach to addressing imbalanced datasets is to oversample the minority class. The simplest approach involves duplicating examples in the minority class, although these examples don’t add any new information to the model. Instead, new examples can be synthesized from the existing examples. This is a type of data augmentation for the minority class and is referred to as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique, or SMOTE for short.
